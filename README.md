# Java-TimeTracker

## Introduction

A command line time tracker using Java.

This little program helps you to record your tasks. It has four main functions:

1. You can record your tasks.
2. You can tag the tasks by adding `#`, for example: 'My task #work' will be grouped as 'work'.
3. You can search your tasks from the history based on the tag.
4. You can generate a weekly summary base on the tag.

The program use serialisation to store the history. Your task will still be recorded even if the program is terminated, until you explicitly terminate it.

The project is created in Eclipse Neon.
